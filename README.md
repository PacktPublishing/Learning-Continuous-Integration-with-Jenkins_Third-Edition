# Learning Continuous Integration with Jenkins - Third Edition

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the examples, configurations and excersises demonstrated for this book. Each code file is organized chapter-wise to help you navigate through them easily. 

## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Fork the Repository
Please fork this repository to have your own version of the code. This allows you to make changes and experiment.

### 2. Navigate the Code
The code files are organized chapter-wise inside each folder named `/chapter-1`, `/chapter-2`, ..., etc. This makes it easier for you to find the relevant code for each section of the book.

### 3. Note on Chapters 8 and 9
The code files for chapters 8 and 9 are the same.

### 4. Refer to the Respective Chapters
Before using the code, make sure to refer to the respective chapters in the book. This will provide you with the necessary background information and instructions on how to effectively use the code examples.

### 5. Replace Placeholder Values
In some code files, you'll find placeholder values denoted by `<...>`. Make sure to replace these with your setup-specific details. For example, replace `<Artifactory Server IP Address>` with your Artifactory server's IP address or URL.

### 6. Deploy in a Sandbox Environment
Before deploying the "Hello World 3-Tier Application" code, along with other scripts found in this repository, it's crucial to use a **sandbox environment**. A sandbox environment is a safe, isolated setup where you can run and test code without affecting your actual system or data. 

This practice is particularly important for:

- Understanding how the application and scripts behave.
- Ensuring there are no unforeseen side effects or issues.
- Protecting your production environment from potential errors during the learning and experimentation phase.

Always review and understand the code and its requirements before deploying it to any environment other than sandbox.
